							<h2>About</h2>
							<p>We are TaroHacks, a first-year online high school and middle school hackathon with the goal of helping students learn new skills to make projects that have an impact on their communities. Although normally hackathons are daylong, in-real-life events, COVID-19 has made this difficult to do, so with this hackathon students will be able to use their skills to create something to benefit society. TaroHacks will take place from August 1st to August 8th, 2020. Our hackathon aims to inspire more students of our generation to get involved and find an interest in technology and engineering even through this pandemic. We want to help promote teamwork, innovation, creativity, and collaboration to encourage students to create solutions to problems in our world. Because TaroHacks is an online hackathon, allowing students from all over the world and country to participate, but our team is based in Santa Clara, California.

As I travelled the world and met kids n’ adults from different facets and economic conditions, I realized there was a need for the potential IDEA within each one to be encouraged. In the pursuit of creating a global community for the most innovative amongst us, iINVENT™ was born. It is the idea, methodology and a community we have adopted in our business solution offerings @ NABROS, learning and incubation solutions @ HUBLI and interior design plus lifestyle solutions @ 1816ZENDEN. We hope you join us to enable your ideas that help you, others and the earth grow.” Listen to his presentation on turning an idea into reality at TaroHacks!
