As I travelled the world and met kids n’ adults from different facets and economic conditions, I realized there was a need for the potential IDEA within each one to be encouraged. In the pursuit of creating a global community for the most innovative amongst us, iINVENT™ was born. It is the idea, methodology and a community we have adopted in our business solution offerings @ NABROS, learning and incubation solutions @ HUBLI and interior design plus lifestyle solutions @ 1816ZENDEN. We hope you join us to enable your ideas that help you, others and the earth grow.” Listen to his presentation on turning an idea into reality at TaroHacks!

We are a seven member team from Santa Clara, California. This is our second year as an FTC team. Our team members this year are: Kavi Rajesh, Kaitlyn Nguyen, Sahana Moogi, Xavier Cairel, James Thornton, Kaushik Salem, and Mokshitaa Dhamotharan. We were formed by the <a href = "https://svefoundation.org/49ers-stem-leadership-institute/">49ers STEM Leadership Institute</a> last year, but since then have grown and changed a lot. We’ve learned a lot in the last year and hope to do even better this season.
